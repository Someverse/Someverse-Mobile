# Someverse
'Someverse' is a taste-based social matching (dating) platform that leverages pop-culture content consumption data. 
By comprehensively analyzing each user's activity across multiple media services (e.g., Netflix, Melon, Megabox, Millie's Library), Someverse matches people with similar preferences and generates a 'taste data' profile that captures individual identity. 
This fulfills the 20-30-something generation's desire to share and empathize over their tastes, while pioneering a new realm of online human connections.
